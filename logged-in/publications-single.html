                                        <h2 class="title">Introduction</h2>
                                        <p>The issue of the state is considered one of the most complicated issues in modern political meeting. It has formed one of the biggest challenges faced by the political Islamic movement since its birth in the twenties of the twentieth century. Notice how the Islamists have become the first of the modern state control in all affairs of life, which is the process of seeing them gradually towards an attempt to capture the reins of power and authority. Without control the reins of the state, saw Islamist political forces, can not be a project of Islamization, which carried him to proceed. But the Islamists did not look at the big difference between the structure of the modern state and the foundations on which it is based, and the model of the Islamic State Historic Astbtnoh.</p>
                                        <p>Because the movement of the Arab revolt led and lead to the arrival of the forces of Islamic many political to the seat of governance and leadership of the state, the question of the state has become more urgent and a cause for controversy, not only because it will determine the pattern of governance and management of the affairs of the country, but also because it will shape the relationship Islamic forces ruling the people and the world.</p>
                                        <p>These preliminary observations on the issue of the modern state, the complexities that surround the project of Islamization, and the limits of this project and its prospects, as it relates to the institution of the modern state, which is the only model available to the state and the unit recognized in international relations.</p>

                                        <h2 class="title">In the traditional political meeting</h2>
                                        <p>As European nations Empire in the Middle Ages was the authority of the Islamic state is limited. One of the reasons for the limits of power that, of course, was slow and inadequate means of communication, including the Transport News, information, and transportation and movement. As the costs of maintaining a military establishment sufficient and full-time is relatively high; Even higher institutions of governance Islamic efficiency in the collection of resources, such as the Ottoman Empire, and found hardship significant in maintaining their armies in good condition, especially after falling pace of conquests and resources provided by.</p>
                                        <p>However, the factor difference between the President of the Islamic state and its European counterpart representing in the role played by the religious establishment, a layer of scientists, in the field of Islamic. Aside from departments directly related to the governance and management (including financial management of the sector), did not enjoy the right of the Islamic state legislation, it has maintained the right institution scientists as guardian of religion and a spokeswoman for the law and the community. And because the state, even the most traditional Muslim countries authoritarian and deviation, set up its own legitimacy on the basis of Islam, has compiled the values ​​of religion between the state and the institution of scientists and the forces of society and his groups different; sense that everyone returned to the reference one, and spoke a common language, and saw the world from the perspective of one.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, unlike the European ecclesiastical institution, did not work in the the Islamic state never achieve total absorption of the Foundation scientists in the body of the State; scientists do not consider themselves, even in the state bureaucracy as the state of the Ottoman building, as a partner in power and authority. Scientists remained layer ranged in the size between the middle circle of power and governance, on the one hand, and the Department of community / group, on the other hand.</p>

                                        <p>In this sense, we can not describe the traditional Islamic state tyranny, or at least, that Astbdadha did not like the tyranny of its European counterpart. Tngll not an Islamic state in the heart of the different groups, which were left to run in the Haaunha independence from the ruling establishment; But in most cases, were not state policies and decisions seen by groups and social groups as strange or illogical. Episode important in the this overlap, partial between the state and the community, certainly due to the role of the bridge (and liaison), which Tahdth Foundation scholars, Islamic common reference between the two parties. Whenever reinforced the point of the Islamic state and the higher the level of Tmahiaa with the values of the Supreme Sharia, whenever expanded them and the joint forces and groups of society. But the ruling class remained with the transcendental, and unrepresentative, just as is the nature of the ruling class in the pre-modern states generally.</p>

                                        <h2 class="title">The birth of the modern state</h2>
                                        <p>However, the world will witness a turning point of great importance in the structure of the state and its relationship to society, in the the Transfiguration began slowly in the area since shortly after the European Renaissance, and after the mid-seventeenth century in particular. European internal conflicts led to the gradual fragmentation of the Holy Empire Romania, and start to form the modern nation-states. Has played wars and religious distinctions an important role in the development of the state apparatus and the establishment of new institutions legitimacies rule. in the keep up with it, contributed to industrial progress and rapid developments in the means of communication in promoting the nascent national identities, also contributed to the strengthening of state power and to maximize their resources, both internal resources, source, or those that flowed from colonies overseas.</p>

                                        <p>There is no conclusive definition of the state that govern us today and is considered the cornerstone of the international system, or the basic unit of relations between the United Nations and the structure of international organizations. Definitions vary state differences in language dictionaries, encyclopedias or dictionaries of the various disciplines of the humanities and social sciences. Identification months of the state, which dates back to the German sociologist Max Weber, which describes the state as a social institution which has a monopoly of violence, generally understood sense of the legitimacy of the monopoly of violence, and induces the meaning of control and domination. But the problem is that the state, as all historical concepts with the extension, can not be defined in the image of the University. However, there is more common labels of the state than others, such as the nation-state (or state - the nation, if we want a literal translation of European origin), and the modern state.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>It is clear that the term of the modern state more comprehensive, and usually assumed that it includes countries that emphasize designated national and the other trying to avoid the emphasis on the national dimension, without omissions College. Relate to the reasons behind the tension, or the contrast between the two terms invisibility, the historical roots of the institution of the state, and multi-Btglyatea.</p>

                                        <p>What does not differ by Students of the modern state that its beginnings back to the Magistrate Westphalia in the 1648, which put an end to the wars of thirty years, when Europe was living tails Renaissance and the birth of the middle classes, and is still prey to conflicts of religious resulting from the split Protestant, and conflicts of princes and kings among themselves about ranges of control and legitimacy, and most of them between the institution and the Empire, which inherited the Holy Empire Romania and the European framework of the collective, about sovereignty. in the Westphalia, and laid the foundations of the idea of ​​political independence, and the correspondence between the rule and the limits of a particular entity that is subject to his control.</p>
                                        <p>The following points may be valid, the findings of Charles Tilley, to summarize the overall features of the modern state and the social conditions of the timeliness of the institution:
                                        </p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Controlled modern state on an area of ​​land connected to the specific, the top source of legitimacy on this earth.</li>
                                            <li>It is a centralized state control, the level of centralization is superior to any level enjoyed by the institution of the state.</li>
                                            <li>It is superior to the institution and is distinct from any other social institution. </li>
                                            <li>It can impose a monopoly claim to control a growing force within the areas governed.</li>
                                            <li>And ensure that these patterns of state justice, the right of assembly, freedom of the media and publishing, the right of petition, the protection of minorities, the defense of life and property, initially in the form of a year, and not due to the influence of the individual or special links.</li>
                                        </ol>

                                        <h2 class="title">Islamic modernization</h2>
                                        <p>Western superiority turned to the source of great interest and concern for repairers late nineteenth century, scientists were men or state or traveler or observers to the working methods of the colonial administrations. Reflected the Islamic response to the challenges imposed by the Western superiority face the fact that the first Islamic retreat in front of the rising power of modern Europe came in the theater of war is not in the fields of law, education and administration. It was no surprise, therefore, that begins the first attempts at the hands of Islamic reform statesmen, such as Selim III and Muhammad Ali Bayat and Tunisia and sultans Qajar, and they were limited to rebuild the military. But it soon became clear that challenges Western was deeper and more inclusive, and that even rebuilding the military were not possible without rebuilding the political, social, economic and widespread. During the period between the mid-nineteenth century and the end of the First World War, most of the land of Islam came to the process of reconstruction or modernization of this, the process that arrived in the often to what looks like a complete rewrite of Islamic societies.</p>

                                        <p>Different tools and the dynamics of modernization programs from one area to another. in the Egypt, Tunisia, Iran, and the Ottoman Empire, the state played a role in the movement of the update; while the colonial administrations are responsible for the change programs in the Algeria, Indonesia and India, all of which have signed a victim of imperialist expansion of the European early. Has resumed the role that colonial administrations in the Egypt and North and West Africa, having signed this country under foreign domination. There is no doubt that the Ottoman modernization project was the most comprehensive modernization projects, as it continued from 1840 until the end of the First World War and the collapse of the state, without any interruption.</p>

                                        <p>One of the most important objectives of the modernization project, as represented by the Ottoman experience, the emphasis and the extension of state control over the land and the community. Called that goal state monopoly to the tools of violence, represented in the modern military, and police and security agencies. It also called for building management hierarchy is personalized (based to a continuum of levels of responsibility), and the imposition of central rule on the areas that were administered locally or semi-autonomous. In order to tighten control of the state and the sustainability of this control, in order to maximize resources, paved new roads and extended railway lines, and telegraph communication networks have been established, has also launched a land reform schemes that have changed the distribution patterns of land ownership and stable for centuries. In order to enter the modern educational system and the adoption of the curriculum central educational institutes that produce the desired style of the modern state employees, in addition to creating a new society and a nation, united by a single vision and a single mode of thinking.</p>

                                        <h2 class="title">Islam, Islamists, and the modern state</h2>
                                        <p>What you mean the one who this biography permission controversial debate in the the Arab political arena, especially in countries that living in a state of revolution and change, about Islam and Islamic political forces and the modern state?</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Given the long human history and the history of political sociology, is a modern state with a short lifespan already, so difficult to understand control unequivocal on the perception of the state of human society and its monopoly on hyperbolic understanding of the international system. But, in spite of the dilemma posed by the modern state of human society, it seems that the modern man on his way to find a replacement for. Perhaps the first task in front of the Arab people today, including the Islamic political forces, working to prevent the collapse of the institution of the state and the spread of chaos, on the one hand, and on the liberation of the country from tyranny, rationalize them and make them more reflective of the popular will and aspirations of the people, on the other hand.</li>
                                            <li>Control of the nation-state model - the modern resulted in, as the unit of the international system and the basis for relations between peoples, to the birth of the concept of a failed state. It is assumed that each state can not possess the basic features of the nation-state - is the result of modern failed state. And sure enough, that the number of modern states which already failed during the period since the end of World War II, or those experiencing structural difficulties, is certainly a large number. There are countries have seen repeated waves of civil wars, against a background of ethnic reasons - ethnic, religious or political, such as Lebanon, Pakistan, the major and Sri Lanka, and Yugoslavia, Georgia, Nigeria, Congo and the Great Lakes countries, Liberia, Ethiopia and Somalia, which is now considered a witness, the most prominent of the failure of the state and the laxity held.
